Users Administration

We want to add user authentication and authorization to our application. Users should be stored in the database and every note should be linked to the user who created it. Deleting and editing a note should only be allowed for the user who created it.

Let's start by adding information about users to the database. There is a one-to-many relationship between the user (User) and notes (Note):

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity trying to access a particular resource or service. The primary goal of authentication is to ensure that the user is who they claim to be. This is typically achieved through the presentation of credentials, such as usernames and passwords, biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition, etc.), smart cards, or other authentication factors.

Example: 
Answers the question, "Who are you?" Once a user's identity is verified successfully, they gain access to the system, service, or application. It establishes a trust relationship between the user and the system, enabling the system to know that the user is legitimate.

Authorization is the process of determining what actions and resources an authenticated user is allowed to access or perform. It follows the authentication step and answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?"

Authorization rules define what actions a user can take, what data they can view or modify, and what functionalities they can use.

In summary, the main difference between authentication and authorization is:

Authentication verifies the user's identity, ensuring they are who they claim to be.

Authorization determines what actions and resources the authenticated user is allowed to access or perform.

To better illustrate this, consider the analogy of entering a secure building:

Authentication is like showing your ID card or providing your fingerprint at the entrance to prove that you are a recognized and authorized employee (verifying your identity).

Authorization is akin to the level of access your ID card grants you within the building â€“ whether you can enter specific rooms, use certain equipment, or access sensitive areas (defining what you are allowed to do based on your identity).
